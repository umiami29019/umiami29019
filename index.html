       About Me: Bryan Wong
    </h1>
    <h2>
        My Background
    </h2>
    <p> I'm born and raised in Queens, New York and love New York City like nowhere else (I want to go back home after I graduate). I went to Stuyvesant High School and am now a senior at the University of Miami. At UM, I am studying Business Technology and Finance - giving me a tech, finance, and investment-oriented background because I love learning about innovation and making money.
        Some nicknames people call me are Bwong or Bluke.

    <h2>
        Professional Goals
    </h2>
    <p> 
        My professional goal is to be an Investment / Research Analyst for an Investment Fund.
    I want to be able to analyze investment opportunities that may be underappreciated, keep up-to-date and predict market trends, and research new technologies - I want to be a part of the decision making process and be responsible for a firm's performance.
    Ideally, I would love to work in the crypto inddustry - it is early-staged fast-paced and crazy, I love the community, and I love learning about the innovative technologies constantly on the horizon.
    I'm not going to be too picky though, I wouldn't mind working in the traditional finance and banking industry but crypto is something I'm really passionate about.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
        My hobbies include working out (4-5x/week), investing in crypto, hanging out with friends, playing basketball, reading books about investing & trading, and traveling to different places.
    I like activities that train my brain, train my body, or sometimes the total opposite.
    </p>

    <p> My favorite place I went to before this year was easily Japan. Japan is so beautiful, clean, and modern. The food is amazing (I'm a big fan of ramen noodles), the beef is also great, everything including the subway stations are clean, and the city is so pretty at night with so many different things to see. </p>
    <p> My favorite place I went to this year was Prague. Prague was the best city I traveled to in Europe - the food is good, the beer is cheep, the architecture is so beautiful (I was told it avoided WWII bombings and their historical architecture is in tact), and the city was very walkable. I was able to explore most of Prague and I went up to towers for stunning views of the city (all orange roofs and spikes).</p>
